<h1 align="center">📊 Deloitte Data Analytics Virtual Internship</h1>

Welcome to my **Deloitte Australia Data Analytics Virtual Internship** project completed on **Forage**!  
This repository showcases my work on two real-world inspired tasks focusing on **Data Analysis (Tableau)** and **Forensic Technology (Excel)**.  

The internship provided hands-on experience in data visualization, classification, and business insights — simulating the type of work done by Deloitte professionals.

## 📘 About the Project

This project involved solving two case-based tasks using data analytics tools:  

> 🏭 *Analyzing factory telemetry data to uncover downtime trends*  
> 🧮 *Classifying employee compensation equality scores for fair assessment*  

By completing these tasks, I demonstrated skills in **Tableau dashboarding**, **Excel-based analysis**, and **business problem-solving with data**.

## 📂 Tasks Overview

### 🔹 Task 1: Data Analysis (Tableau)
- Imported **Daikibo telemetry JSON data** into Tableau.  
- Created a calculated field **“Unhealthy”** (10 mins downtime for each unhealthy status).  
- Built two bar charts:  
  - **Down Time per Factory**  
  - **Down Time per Device Type**  
- Designed an **interactive dashboard** where selecting a factory filters device type downtime.  
- Identified the factory with the **highest downtime** and presented results visually.  

📊 **Deliverable:**  
- Tableau Dashboard ('Task 1.twbx')
- Tableau Dashboard Screenshot (`Task 1.png`)

### 🔹 Task 2: Forensic Technology (Excel)
- Analyzed **employee compensation equality scores**.  
- Created a classification column **“Equality Class”** based on score ranges:  
  - `Fair` → between -10 and +10  
  - `Unfair` → between -20 and -10 OR 10 and 20  
  - `Highly Discriminative` → below -20 or above 20  
- Updated dataset with classifications for all records.  

📊 **Deliverable:**  
- Completed Excel File (`Task 2 Solution.xlsx`)
